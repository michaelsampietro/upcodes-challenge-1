# Coding Challenge - Roman Numeral Converter

This app converts Roman numerals to Arabic numerals.

### How to run?
If you already have npm, node and jest installed globally, you can run the following commands:
- `npm run start` to run the app (it'll log the converted numbers in the terminal)
- `npm run test` run the unit tests for the app

If you don't have npm/node, install them and then run `npm run install` (it'll install jest locally). After these installations, you can run the commands listed before.

### How to change the inputs?
Simply open the `inputs.js` file and add/remove from the `inputs` array. If an invalid input is provided, the converter will return 0.
